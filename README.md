Excel data entry bot for helping me manage my monthly budget and finances

# TODO
-> Create a system for webscraping the csv data from Westpac account
-> Create basic CLI front-end for logging in and specifying transaction date range
-> For uncategorized transactions, give the user the option to: add them all to the 'other' category, or dump them to a separate file.
-> Create a 'last sync' timestamp which contains the date the script was last run on the excel sheet, so that in the next run, the bot can simply get all transactions after that date.
-> Add date insertion for each transaction
